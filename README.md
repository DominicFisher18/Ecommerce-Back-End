# E-Commerce Back End #

**Note:** This repository contains the source code for module 13 homework of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

The goal of this assignment was to create a functioning back end to an ecommerce website.  In the past decade, ecommerce websites have become extremely popular, so having a structurally sound back end is crucial to the succcess of an online business.  I have made progress on this assignment but have not fully finished it.  I installed all the required packages, created the databases, and finished the models; but the API routes and seeding still needs to be completed.
